“People who are really serious about AGI should make their own hardware and software”
― Alan Kay mashup

Why ?

- [x] Because it's fun and building future should be fun
- [x] Because we can build unlimited freedom over the entire AGI stack (metal, kernel, userland)
- [x] Because we can build a system that is not limited by the current status quo of Linux
- [x] Because we can build a system that can truly compete with iOS and macOS UI/UX
- [x] Because we love FreeBSD and NetBSD culture and it's time to bring it to mainstream end users
- [x] Because we can build a system that can run solid on cars, PLC's and PDI's, servers, desktops, laptops, tablets, phones, watches, glasses, etc
